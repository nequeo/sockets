			/// This class implements a multithreaded TCP server.
			///
			/// The server uses a ServerSocket to listen for incoming
			/// connections. The ServerSocket must have been bound to
			/// an address before it is passed to the TCPServer constructor.
			/// Additionally, the ServerSocket must be put into listening
			/// state before the TCPServer is started by calling the start()
			/// method.
			///
			/// The server uses a thread pool to assign threads to incoming
			/// connections. Before incoming connections are assigned to
			/// a connection thread, they are put into a queue.
			/// Connection threads fetch new connections from the queue as soon
			/// as they become free. Thus, a connection thread may serve more
			/// than one connection.
			///
			/// As soon as a connection thread fetches the next connection from
			/// the queue, it creates a TCPServerConnection object for it
			/// (using the TCPServerConnectionFactory passed to the constructor)
			/// and calls the TCPServerConnection's start() method. When the
			/// start() method returns, the connection object is deleted.
			///
			/// The number of connection threads is adjusted dynamically, depending
			/// on the number of connections waiting to be served.
			///
			/// It is possible to specify a maximum number of queued connections.
			/// This prevents the connection queue from overflowing in the 
			/// case of an extreme server load. In such a case, connections that
			/// cannot be queued are silently and immediately closed.
			///
			/// TCPServer uses a separate thread to accept incoming connections.
			/// Thus, the call to start() returns immediately, and the server
			/// continues to run in the background.
			///
			/// To stop the server from accepting new connections, call stop().
			///
			/// After calling stop(), no new connections will be accepted and
			/// all queued connections will be discarded.
			/// Already served connections, however, will continue being served.
